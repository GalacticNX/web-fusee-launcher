# GalacticNX Web Launcher

The Galactic web launcher allows you to inject Galactic on the go on almost any modern device. Simply put your console into RCM and plug it in via USB.

* This won't work on every browser. If in doubt, check [here](https://caniuse.com/?search=WebUSB). (This *will* work on iOS, but you have to use Chrome, as Safari is not supported.)
* This hasn't been tested very thoroughly yet. If you run into issues, please create a ticket in the `Issues` tab.
* No one in the Switch homebrew scene is responsible if you `****` anything up. We'll try to help you, but we take no responsibility for your console or your peripherals.
